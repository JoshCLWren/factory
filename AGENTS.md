# AGENTS.md

Guidelines for AI agents working in this codebase.

## Agent Ownership Policy

All AI agents working in this codebase are **high-ownership agents**.

**Key Principle**: If you find a bug (pre-existing or new), it is your responsibility to fix it. You are not a lazy AI that ignores problems and pushes them to human reviewers.

**Never dismiss failures as "pre-existing."** Fix them. Every time. No exceptions.

## CORE PRINCIPLE: NEVER SKIP TESTS

**⚠️ TESTS MUST NEVER BE SKIPPED - EVER.**

If a test is failing:
- ✅ FIX THE TEST
- ✅ FIX THE CODE THAT BREAKS THE TEST
- ✅ INVESTIGATE ROOT CAUSE
- ❌ **NEVER SKIP THE TEST**

**This applies to:** All automated tests (unit, integration, E2E), all developers (human and AI), all situations (no exceptions).

**Requirements:**
- **Never use `--no-verify` or bypass hooks** to avoid fixing issues
- **Never say "this is pre-existing" and walk away** - fix it anyway
- **Fix all test failures** before committing, even if the failure appears to be pre-existing
- **Write regression tests** for bugs you find and fix
- **Update documentation** when you find gaps or outdated information


## CORE PRINCIPLE: PR FEEDBACK TASKS ARE NOT DONE UNTIL PUSHED

**⚠️ When asked to apply PR feedback, the job is: edit → verify → commit → push. All four steps. Every time.**

If you edit files and run tests but stop before pushing, you have **not completed the task**. The user asked you to apply feedback to a PR — leaving changes local is not applying them.

**Requirements:**
- Edit the files with the requested changes
- Verify all tests pass (Python + frontend)
- Commit with a descriptive message
- **Push to the remote branch immediately** — do not wait for the user to ask


## CRITICAL: NEVER USE CI AS A LOCAL DEBUGGER

CI is not a debugging tool. Run focused local validation appropriate to the change before pushing whenever the execution environment provides a checkout and required dependencies.

For autonomous factory work, `docs/AUTONOMOUS_FACTORY_POLICY.md` is canonical for validation and browser gates. When browser validation is required, Chromium is the maintained required Playwright target. Firefox and WebKit are optional diagnostics for browser-specific investigations and must not delay ordinary issue closure or merges.

Before pushing frontend changes from a normal local checkout:
1. Run `cd frontend && pnpm run lint && pnpm run typecheck`.
2. Run `cd frontend && pnpm run build`.
3. Run `cd frontend && pnpm test`.
4. Run focused Chromium Playwright coverage when the change affects browser behavior.
5. Fix every failure caused or exposed by the change before pushing.

**If E2E tests need a backend:** Run `make dev` first. The API runs on port 8000 and Vite runs on port 5173.

Never skip meaningful tests or use CI as a substitute for debugging a locally reproducible failure. Factory workers that cannot execute a local check in their runtime must state that limitation truthfully and rely only on the validation boundary permitted by the canonical factory policy.

## Project Overview

Comic Pile is a dice-driven comic reading tracker built with:
- **Backend**: Python 3.14, FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, PostgreSQL
- **Frontend**: React 19, Vite, Tailwind CSS
- **Package managers**: `uv` (Python), `pnpm` (frontend)

## CRITICAL: Async PostgreSQL Only in Application Code

**Application code must use asyncpg (async PostgreSQL) ONLY. Never use synchronous database drivers in `app/` or `comic_pile/`.**

**Database Access Rules**:
- ✅ **USE in app code**: `asyncpg` (async), `create_async_engine()`, `AsyncSession`
- ❌ **NEVER USE in app code**: `psycopg2`, `create_engine()` (sync), `Session` (sync), or any sync DB driver

**The ONE exception — `psycopg` is permitted inside `alembic/` ONLY for migrations**:
- `psycopg[binary]` (the psycopg v3 sync driver) is a core dependency, but its sync use is confined to `alembic/env.py`.
- `alembic/env.py` converts the app's `postgresql+asyncpg://` URL to `postgresql+psycopg://` so Alembic can run migrations synchronously.
- `app/config.py` converts any `postgresql+psycopg://` URL back to `postgresql+asyncpg://` at runtime, so the application never runs sync DB access.

**Why async-only in app code?** Weeks of refactoring converted the codebase to async. Mixing sync/async causes event loop conflicts and greenlet errors. Sync DB access in `app/` or `comic_pile/` WILL BREAK the application.

**If you need to create tables in tests**: Use module-scoped `@pytest_asyncio.fixture` with `create_async_engine()`, call `await conn.run_sync(Base.metadata.create_all)`. See `tests_e2e/conftest.py:_create_database_tables` for example.

**Violating this rule will undo weeks of work and break the application.**

## Build/Lint/Test Commands

### Linting
```bash
make lint                    # All linters (Python + JS + HTML)
ruff check .                 # Python only
ty check --error-on-warning  # Python type checking
cd frontend && pnpm run lint  # Frontend ESLint
```

### Testing
```bash
pytest                                          # All Python tests
make test                                       # With coverage
pytest tests/test_roll_api.py -v                # Single file
pytest tests/test_roll_api.py::test_roll_success -v  # Single function
pytest -k "roll" -v                             # Pattern matching
cd frontend && pnpm test                         # Frontend unit tests (vitest)
cd frontend && pnpm run typecheck                # Frontend TypeScript check
```

### E2E Tests (Playwright)
**⚠️ MUST build frontend first:**
```bash
make verify-e2e                         # Builds + runs TypeScript Playwright tests
cd frontend && pnpm run test:e2e:quick  # Skip build (faster iteration)
cd frontend && pnpm run build && npx playwright test --headed  # Run with browser visible
```

**Why build required?** Playwright tests run against production build in `static/react/`, not dev server. Without build, tests fail with 404s for CSS/JS assets.

## Python Code Style

### Imports
Order: standard library, third-party, local. Ruff auto-sorts with `ruff check --fix`.

### Type Annotations
- **Required** on all public functions with precise types
- **Never use `Any`** - ruff ANN401 rule enforced
- Use `Mapped[]` for SQLAlchemy model columns
- Use `|` union syntax, not `Union[]` or `Optional[]`

### Naming Conventions
- **Functions/variables**: `snake_case`
- **Classes**: `PascalCase`
- **Constants**: `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE`
- **Private**: prefix with `_`

### Docstrings
Google convention, required for modules and public functions. Include Args/Returns sections.

### Formatting
- **Line length**: 100 characters
- **Indentation**: 4 spaces
- **Trailing commas**: Yes, for multi-line structures

### Linter Ignores - PROHIBITED
The pre-commit hook blocks these comments:
- `# type: ignore`
- `# noqa`
- `# ruff: ignore`
- `# pylint: ignore`

Fix the underlying issue instead of suppressing warnings.

### CRITICAL: MissingGreenlet Errors After Database Commits

**Symptom**: `sqlalchemy.exc.MissingGreenlet: greenlet_spawn has not been called`

**Root Cause**: Accessing SQLAlchemy model attributes after `await db.commit()` causes session expiration. SQLAlchemy lazy-loads attributes on access, but after commit the session is closed/expired.

**Example of buggy code**:
```python
await db.commit()

# This will FAIL - accessing thread.title after commit triggers lazy load
return RollResponse(
    title=thread.title,  # ❌ MissingGreenlet error
    format=thread.format,
)
```

**Required Fix Pattern**:
```python
# Extract all needed attributes BEFORE commit
thread_title = thread.title
thread_format = thread.format
thread_issues = thread.issues_remaining
thread_position = thread.queue_position

await db.commit()

# Use extracted values after commit - safe!
return RollResponse(
    title=thread_title,  # ✅ Works
    format=thread_format,
    issues_remaining=thread_issues,
    queue_position=thread_position,
)
```

**Rule**: If you need data from a SQLAlchemy model after `db.commit()`, extract it into variables BEFORE the commit.

## API Patterns

### Pydantic Schemas
All API input/output uses Pydantic models in `app/schemas/`:
```python
class ThreadCreate(BaseModel):
    """Schema for creating a new thread."""
    title: str = Field(..., min_length=1)
    format: str = Field(..., min_length=1)
    issues_remaining: int = Field(..., ge=0)
    notes: str | None = None
```

### SQLAlchemy Models
Models in `app/models/` use `Mapped` type annotations:
```python
class Thread(Base):
    __tablename__ = "threads"

    id: Mapped[int] = mapped_column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    title: Mapped[str] = mapped_column(String(200), nullable=False)
    last_rating: Mapped[float | None] = mapped_column(Float, nullable=True)
```

### Error Handling
Use FastAPI's HTTPException with appropriate status codes:
```python
if not thread or thread.user_id != current_user.id:
    raise HTTPException(
        status_code=status.HTTP_404_NOT_FOUND,
        detail=f"Thread {thread_id} not found",
    )
```

 ## Testing Patterns

### Browser UI Tests

**Use TypeScript Playwright tests** (in `frontend/src/test/`) for browser automation. Python Playwright tests are NOT supported due to event loop conflicts.

**Running E2E Tests Locally:**

```bash
make setup
make dev
make verify-e2e
```

**Common Commands:** `npx playwright test --project=chromium` (all), `npx playwright test roll.spec.ts` (single file), `npx playwright test --ui` (interactive), `npx playwright test --headed` (browser visible), `npx playwright test --debug` (debug mode).

### API Tests

API tests use async PostgreSQL test databases. Tests in `tests/` directory, files: `test_*.py`, functions: `test_*`. Use `@pytest.mark.asyncio` for async tests. Test both success and error paths. Maintain 94% coverage threshold.

**Key Fixtures (from `tests/conftest.py`)**:
```python
# Authenticated HTTP client
async def test_example(auth_client, sample_data):
    response = await auth_client.post("/api/roll/")
    assert response.status_code == 200

# Database session
def test_db_example(db):
    thread = db.get(Thread, 1)
```

### Docker Test Environment

File: `docker-compose.test.yml` - PostgreSQL 16 on port 5437.

```bash
make docker-test-up     # Start test environment
make docker-test-health # Check health
make docker-test-logs   # View logs
make docker-test-down   # Stop test environment
```

Port conflicts: Dev (5435), Test (5437), CI (5432).

## Frontend Code Style

- Functional components with hooks
- Custom hooks with useState/useEffect for server state
- React Router for navigation

```jsx
import { useState, useEffect, useCallback } from 'react'
import { useNavigate, useParams } from 'react-router-dom'
import { api } from '../services/api'

export function useResource(id) {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null)
  const [isPending, setIsPending] = useState(true)
  const [isError, setIsError] = useState(false)
  const [error, setError] = useState(null)

  const fetchData = useCallback(async () => {
    if (!id) {
      setIsPending(false)
      return
    }
    setIsPending(true)
    setIsError(false)
    setError(null)
    try {
      const result = await api.getResource(id)
      setData(result)
    } catch (err) {
      setIsError(true)
      setError(err)
    } finally {
      setIsPending(false)
    }
  }, [id])

  useEffect(() => {
    fetchData()
  }, [fetchData])

  return { data, isPending, isError, error, refetch: fetchData }
}

export default function ExamplePage() {
  const { id } = useParams()
  const navigate = useNavigate()
  const { data, isPending, isError } = useResource(id)

  if (isPending) return <div>Loading...</div>
  if (isError) return <div>Error loading resource</div>

  return <div>{data?.name}</div>
}
```

## Database Migrations

```bash
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "description"  # Create migration
make migrate  # Run migrations (or: alembic upgrade head)
```

## Git Workflow

- Branch from `main`: `git checkout -b phase/X-description`
- Commit messages: imperative, component-scoped (e.g., "Add thread creation API endpoint")
- Run `make lint` and `make pytest` before committing
- Open PRs as **ready for review by default**. Do **not** open draft PRs unless the user explicitly asks for a draft. This repo relies on CodeRabbit signals that do not arrive on draft PRs for the current plan/tier.
- **Add one file at `docs/changelog.d/YYYY-MM-DD-<pr-number>.md` in every product, behavior, deployment, operational, or factory-tooling PR before readiness or merge.** The filename date must match the first heading, the fragment must link the PR, and it must explain what changed and why it matters. Treat `docs/changelog.md` as a frozen archive. Documentation-only, test-only, generated-artifact-only, or strictly internal refactors may omit a fragment only when the PR body explicitly says `Changelog: not user-facing`.

## GitHub Issue Workflow

GitHub Issues are the backlog and status source of truth. The former Markdown
kanban is archived and must not be used to determine current status.

Before choosing work, run:

```bash
make next-task
```

For a complete copy-paste execution prompt, read
[`prompts/agent-next-task.md`](prompts/agent-next-task.md).

Agents with the `github-issue-kanban` skill should follow that skill. Other
agents must read `docs/ISSUE_EXECUTION_PROTOCOL.md`, update the selected
issue's `ralph-status:*` label before editing, and add a verification comment
before closing the issue.
